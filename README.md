Introduction in Reconfigurable Computing (using reconfigurable Systems-on-Chip rSoC). This project is an educational implementation of a custom IP module which communicates with DMAe using AXIS4 Streaming Protocol.


## Documentation
### Reports
If you want more information about each module you could read (or just try to read, unfortunately at this point are only in greek language) the following report files:
* [TODO: Milestone 1](./doc/Milestone-1.pdf)

### Diagrams

Block and timing diagrams are able to be changed:
* For [xml](./doc/schematics/) files (block diagrams) we have used [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)
* For [json](./doc/timingDiagram/) file (timing diagram) we have used [Wavedrom editor](https://wavedrom.com)
